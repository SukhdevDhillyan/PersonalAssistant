Store conversation history, user preferences, and action items.
Maintain a long-term memory for persistent knowledge and a short-term memory for ongoing conversations.




For Master AI to function effectively, it needs to remember past conversations, tasks, reminders, user preferences, and ongoing action items. We'll implement two types of memory:

Short-term Memory

Tracks the current session’s context (ongoing conversation).
Useful for understanding user intent within a single interaction.
Long-term Memory

Stores user interactions, preferences, and past conversations.
Helps AI make better decisions over time.
Can be implemented using a vector database (like Pinecone, ChromaDB) or traditional DBs (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).




We have two main options:

✅ Local Storage (File or SQLite)

Easy to set up but limited in scalability.
Works well for early testing.
✅ Vector Database (Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate, FAISS)

Stores interactions as embeddings, making memory retrieval smarter.
Allows semantic search (AI understands the meaning, not just keywords).
Best for long-term use.
For now, let’s start with a simple implementation using SQLite for structured data, and later integrate a vector database for advanced AI memory.
